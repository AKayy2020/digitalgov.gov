title: 'Summer Health and Safety: A New Resource Brought to You by CDC and NIH'
summary: 'We have previously written about microsites in the federal government. A microsite is a small collection of web pages&mdash;a subset of an organizationâ€™s full website. Partners can embed microsites that present curated information on a specific topic or campaign directly within their own websites. And perhaps best of all, microsites that are API-enabled are maintained and updated'
